# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
- For this project I was tasked to start from scratch to create a webpage for displaying weather and other various things when a input is put in the search box.
- My motivation for this project was so I can better understand javascript and API's since I have been struggling with JavaScript the most so far in this course.
- The reason I built and edited this assignment was because if I or someone else was in need of finding out what the weather is in our area and our apps for it on our phones per say were not working this would be a great resource.
- During this project I learned how to problem solve on my own by using resources such as google and AI tools to give me a better understanding of things I just cant seem to grasp such as some terminology used inside of java script and how to link and use API's better, and comparing code with other code I already had to see why something did or did not work, as well as using the developer tools inside of google chrome to troubleshoot and inspect things further.
